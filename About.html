When Anne and Dave were newlyweds, they were looking to start their family. 
One day, while Anne was out on a walk, she found a pup shivering by a dumpster.
Always an animal lover, Anne decided to take the puppy home and nurse her back to
health. Anne and Dave searched for her owner for days, with no luck. Finally, they 
decided to adopt her, and named her Hope, to celebrate the hope they she gave them
for their new little family. Although thier little family slowly grew to seven, 
they're love for animals only grew with their new additions. Now Anne and Dave, 
their four children and furry companion have devoted their lives to 
adding special new members to other people's families. They fully believe in the 
power of animals to spread love and kindness. Their mission is to find
new homes for as many rescue dogs as possible, and with the help of Hope, they
are well on their way. They hope that you can find your new best friend with their
family's help.
