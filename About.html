    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>When Anne and Dave were newlyweds, they were looking to start their family. One day, while Anne was out on a walk, she found a pup shivering by a dumpster. Always an animal lover, Anne decided to take the puppy home and nurse her back to health. Anne and Dave searched for her owner for days, with no luck. Finally, they decided to adopt her and named her Hope, to celebrate the hope she gave them for their new little family. Although their little family slowly grew to seven, their love for animals only grew with their new additions. Now Anne and Dave, their four children, and furry companion have devoted their lives to adding special new members to other people's families. They fully believe in the power of animals to spread love and kindness. Their mission is to find new homes for as many rescue dogs as possible, and with the help of Hope, they are well on their way. They hope that you can find your new best friend with their family's help.</p>
